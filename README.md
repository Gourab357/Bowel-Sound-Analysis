# Bowel-Sound-Analysis Using Machine Learning (Machine Learning, AI model)

• Developed a non-invasive, AI-driven system to classify bowel sounds into Healthy or Unhealthy for early detection of gastrointestinal disorders — addressing the rising global concern of bowel-related conditions, including bowel cancer.

• Achieved 85.82% classification accuracy using a CNN trained on Mel-spectrograms, outperforming SVM and logistic regression models.

• Extracted acoustic features (MFCCs, Jitter, Shimmer, Pitch, HNR) from a clinical dataset from Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland (411 healthy, 393 unhealthy samples).

• Currently developing a web-based application for real-time bowel sound monitoring and planning to improve the model using hybrid CNN-RNN architectures.
