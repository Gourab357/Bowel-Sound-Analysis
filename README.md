# Bowel-Sound-Analysis for Health Classification (Machine Learning, AI model)
• Developed an AI-driven system using SVM classification to analyze bowel sounds for early gut health diagnosis, achieving 74.48% accuracy.

• Extracted key acoustic features (MFCCs, Jitter, Shimmer, Pitch, HNR) from 420 healthy & 250 unhealthy bowel sound recordings for classification.

• Planning to enhance the model with CNN for improved accuracy and deploy it as a web-based application for real-time health analysis.
